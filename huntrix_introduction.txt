# Introduction to Huntrix (from K-Pop Demon Hunters)

## Group Overview

Huntrix (stylized as HUNTR/X) is the fictional three-member K-pop girl group at the heart of the Netflix animated film "K-Pop Demon Hunters," released in June 2025 [source:2, 5, 23]. While publicly known as global music superstars, the trio leads a secret double life as the latest generation of demon hunters [source:1, 3, 5].

By day, Rumi, Mira, and Zoey sell out stadiums and top music charts with hits like "Golden" [source:5, 23]. By night, they use their powers to protect humanity from supernatural threats [source:5, 22]. Their concerts are secretly powerful rituals that gather the emotional energy of their fans to strengthen the "Honmoon," a magical barrier that keeps demons from invading the human world [source:5, 22]. The group was formed by Celine, a member of a previous generation of K-pop demon hunters called the Starlight Sisters [source:5, 22].
