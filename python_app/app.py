    # To run this application, save it as app.py and execute it using Python 3.
    # Example:
    # $ python3 app.py
    # Enter the character you love:
    # zoey and rumi and mira and huntrix
    # I love Huntrix!
    # If the input is incorrect:
    # $ python3 app.py
    # Enter the character you love:
    # some other character
    # Try again!
